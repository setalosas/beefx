The original goal was to make an extendable library of audio effects. As these filters are quite difficult to test without an existing audio environment, it appeared a good idea to create a test app. So the Playground subproject was born as a testing tool, but then it grew beyond this original goal and became an interactive testing bed with small Ui widgets for the effects.
